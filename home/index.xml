      <description>About I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of British Columbia being advised by Özgür Yilmaz and Yaniv Plan. My research is in the area of compressed sensing, convex optimization and machine learning &amp;mdash; comprising aspects of high-dimensional probability, applications of random matrix theory, convex analysis and geometric functional analysis.
During October 2016 &amp;ndash; February 2017 I completed an internship with Awake Labs, where I worked as a data scientist developing online algorithms for performing learning tasks on structured high-dimensional physiological data.</description>
