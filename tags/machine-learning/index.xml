      <description>Summary This is a summary and reflection from co-organizing the second iteration of the BC Data Workshop.
About The BC Data Workshop was hosted June 4 &amp;ndash; 8 on the UBC campus, co-organized with the IAM Director Brian Wetton, supported by PIMS.
The workshop featured a wide array of problem material from industry in the lower mainland, channeled as week-long data science projects led by industry mentors.
Projects Project 1: SSR Mining Participants analyzed over 50 GB of data for particular heavy equipment used in an ongoing mining operation to discover patterns in equipment failure for predictive maintenance strategies.</description>

      <description>Summary This is a brief summary and some incomplete reflections from my time as the workshop TA for the 2017 BC Data Science Workshop.
About The BC Data Workshop was hosted August 9 &amp;ndash; 25 in downtown Vancouver at UBC Robson Square, co-organized by myself, Brian Wetton and Lee Rippon from the IAM, with support from PIMS and SFU Mathematics.
The workshop featured a wide array of material from experts across the west coast, structured into three sections: a 3-day pre-workshop intensive; a week of introductory material; and a week-long data science project led by industry mentors.</description>
