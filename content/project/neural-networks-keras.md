## Description

This project is a five notebook tutorial available on GitHub, covering a brisk introduction to neural networks in `keras` using `tensorflow`. Note that various material has been borrowed, modified or shortened from the tensorflow and keras blogs. The repository is available on GitHub as [Neural networks in `keras`](https://github.com/bcdataca/workshop-content/tree/master/1-first-week/mini-projects/3-neural-networks).
