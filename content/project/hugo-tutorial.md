### Description

Learn how to get up and running with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a popular
open-source static site generator that's fast and easy to use. Attendees can
follow a live coding session to learn how to generate and customize a brand new
Hugo website. We'll learn how to host the website from a GitHub repository using
GitHub Pages. Time and interest permitting, we'll explore how to host the site
on a custom domain (like [asberk.ca](http://asberk.ca)). This tutorial is the
perfect starting point for breaking away from the frumpy academic webpages of
yore, and attracting those shiny impressions that'll make your Google Analytics
page sing.

### Requirements

To be completed by attendees before the tutorial:

* [Install hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) (e.g., using
  `brew install hugo`). If installed correctly, running `hugo version` in
  Terminal shouldn't return an error.
* Have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) (it's free to sign up)
* Ensure [git is installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads). If installed
  correctly, running `git --version` in Terminal shouldn't return an error.
* (Optional) Have an account with a domain registrar (e.g. [Google
  Domains](https://domains.google/), [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/),
  [CIRA](https://cira.ca/), etc.)



### Disclaimer

This tutorial claims absolutely no originality. It is merely a curation of the
four articles below, designed so that virtually anyone in attendance can get a
website up and running in one hour.

For more details than what's covered in the tutorial, Hugo offers a [Quickstart
Guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and a post covering
[Basic Usage](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/). In addition, there is
an article about [hosting on
GitHub](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) and about
[hosting on a custom
domain](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#use-a-custom-domain).

Notes for this presentation will be made available on this page after the
tutorial.
