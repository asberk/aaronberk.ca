## Day 2 --- Coding in Python

Welcome to Day 3 of the Math section of Future Science Leaders! Today, you will
get to explore a series of activities that will have you coding and problem
solving in Python. If you don't have Python already installed your laptop, no
worries! Simply go to [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python). There should
be no need to make an account. We'll be walking around to make sure you're able
to get up and running.

Before you start coding, have a look through the
[Introduction](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8z34jqllpx3pv2g/Intro.pdf?dl=0) and
[Flowchart](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xxewna0jroid0uy/FlowChart.pdf?dl=0)
documents. These will give you some idea of where to begin, and what comes next.

If you're new to Python or coding, or if you could use a refresher, then try
exploring the
[Numbers](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1xi3fwbajlb0wkf/Numbers.pdf?dl=0) worksheet
next. Afterward, check out [Conditional
Statements](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yigvcjad8lxeyno/Conditional_Statements.pdf?dl=0), and
then [Loops](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l356bnhbtra7mxz/Loops.pdf?dl=0). If you
know how to program in another language, and want to see one of many things that
makes Python special, you can check out
[Loops2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ccbpsdb98pubt1n/Loops2.pdf?dl=0).

Once you feel comfortable with the content above, you might wish to try out the
[Choose Your Own Adventure
game](https://repl.it/@asberk/dungeongame). If you think
you might like to build your own, then why don't you try making your very own
[Choice Game](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zg3lbgz4yy36ukd/ChoiceGame.pdf?dl=0)?

If these challenges *still* aren't hard enough for you, then you can try out
some of our **challenge problems**. For example (in order of difficulty):

* [12Days](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dthm53tzwc7f2pk/12Days.pdf?dl=0)
* [Root](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dthm53tzwc7f2pk/12Days.pdf?dl=0)
* [Caesar](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n77oeri7kgnsag4/Caesar.pdf?dl=0)
* [Three ultra-challenging problems](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m83ub86evk40sib/UltraChallenging.pdf?dl=0) (attribution unknown)

**Note:** to attempt the Caesar challenge, you'll first want to "Fork" the
[associated `FSL20d2` REPL](https://repl.it/@asberk/) before getting
started. Feel free to ask us for help along the way! If some of the Python
syntax or notation seems "weird", that's because we haven't talked about
it. Come ask us for some pointers!


<!-- ## About Future Science Leaders -->

<!-- [Future Science Leaders](https://www.scienceworld.ca/futurescienceleaders) is -->
<!-- an academic engagement opportunity for high school children. "In weekly -->
<!-- meetings, students learn essential skills, meet top experts and innovators and -->
<!-- apply their new knowledge and skills" with the expectation of "[excelling] in -->
<!-- national and international science, technology, engineering and math -->
<!-- challenges". The math theme comprises three weeks of the program. During this -->
<!-- time, students learn some elements of graph theory (labelling and traversal), -->
<!-- elementary number theory (modular arithmetic and cryptography), and -->
<!-- applications to computing with Python (root-finding, cryptography, games, and -->
<!-- more). Have a gander at a previous iteration of [the Math -->
<!-- theme](https://www.scienceworld.ca/sites/default/files/Math%20copy.pdf) and -->
<!-- stay tuned for this year's iteration! -->
