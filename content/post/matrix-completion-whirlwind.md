## Summary

I recently wrote some basic Python functions for a matrix completion tutorial, covering elementary theory and a couple popular convex optimization methods for matrix completion.

The [repository is available](https://github.com/asberk/matrix-completion-whirlwind) on GitHub, including the Jupyter notebook, which can be [viewed on GitHub](https://github.com/asberk/matrix-completion-whirlwind/blob/master/matrix_completion_master.ipynb), as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/asberk/8c8fd1e7f384df0183b8f01423c07a55), or below.
