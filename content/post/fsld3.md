## Day 3 --- Coding in Python

Welcome to Day 3 of the Math section of Future Science Leaders! Today, you will
get to explore a series of activities that will have you coding and problem
solving in Python. If you don't have Python already installed your laptop, no
worries! Simply go to [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python). There should
be no need to make an account. We'll be walking around to make sure you're able
to get up and running.

Before you start coding, have a look through the
[Introduction](https://www.dropbox.com/s/chd1ssdaykqm99z/Intro.pdf?dl=0) and
[Flowchart](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wwsvou0fumwcepr/FlowChart.pdf?dl=0)
documents. These will give you some idea of where to begin, and what comes next.

If you're new to Python or coding, or if you could use a refresher, then try
exploring the
[Numbers](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y57ssnbi64q6eu7/Numbers.pdf?dl=0) worksheet
next. Afterward, check out [Conditional
Statements](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1gwgi98xnc22u20/Conditional_Statements.pdf?dl=0),
and then [Loops](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vi1ehvui01hhmph/Loops.pdf?dl=0).

Once you feel comfortable with the content above, you might wish to try out the
[Choose Your Own Adventure
game](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4e2zsjd3ltl9v8r/dungeon.py?dl=0). If you think
you might like to build your own, then why don't you try making your very own
[Choice Game](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1t4g8g2hsm66evv/ChoiceGame.pdf?dl=0)?

If these challenges *still* aren't hard enough for you, then you can try out
some of our **challenge problems**. For example (in order of difficulty):

* [12Days](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jugkm3i4ow3uzau/12Days.pdf?dl=0)
* [Root](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kj517lcmlezgk7o/Root.pdf?dl=0)
* [Caesar](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ng5z7z314z9tdxi/Caesar.pdf?dl=0)

**Note:** to attempt the Caesar challenge, you'll first want to "Fork" the
[associated `FSLd3` REPL](https://repl.it/@asberk/) before getting started. Feel
free to ask us for help along the way! If some of the Python syntax or notation
seems "weird" or like something we haven't covered, come ask us for some
pointers!
