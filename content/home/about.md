# About

I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of
British Columbia being advised by
[Özgür Yilmaz](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~oyilmaz/) and
[Yaniv Plan](http://www.yanivplan.com/). My research is in the area of
[compressed sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing),
[convex optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_optimization) and
[machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) &mdash;
comprising aspects of high-dimensional probability, applications of random
matrix theory, convex analysis and geometric functional analysis.

During October 2016 &ndash; February 2017 I completed an internship with
[Awake Labs](http://www.awakelabs.com/), where I worked as a data scientist
developing online algorithms for performing learning tasks on structured
high-dimensional physiological data.

I completed my MSc Mathematics in August 2014 at the University of Toronto. My
supervisor was
[Dr. Adrian Nachman](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/nachman-a/), under whom
I researched fast computational methods in image processing with applications
in medical imaging. Before that, I completed my BSc in Mathematics & Statistics
at McMaster University in Hamilton, ON.
