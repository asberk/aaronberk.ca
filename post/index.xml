      <description>Summary This is a brief summary and some incomplete reflections from my time as the workshop TA for the 2017 BC Data Science Workshop.

The workshop featured a wide array of material from experts across the west coast, structured into three sections: a 3-day pre-workshop intensive; a week of introductory material; and a week-long data science project led by industry mentors.</description>
